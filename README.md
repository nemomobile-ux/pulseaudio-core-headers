# PulseAudio Private Headers

PulseAudio Core headers required by modules built out of tree.

On PulseAudio version change, update version in
rpm/pulseaudio-core-headers.spec (for local builds) and tag the
repository using PulseAudio version. If needed, tag with the extended
version string by using extra `.` . The tag is used in OBS builds.
